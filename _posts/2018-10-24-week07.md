__2.__ On the top menu bar, I pressed the Reports button which directed me to a page with three Headings called "Generic GNOME reports", "For Potential Contributors", "Explanation of various terms and fields". Under the Explanation of various terms and fields there is a link called Bug Fields. That link opens a page that has all the definitions and information needed to answer the first question.

__3.__ The bugs are initially displayed using the id column. The ids of the bugs are ordered from least to greatest. 

__4.__ Each color represents the importance of the bug. __Black__ color bugs mean that the importance can be any combination between normal, urgent, high, low, with minor, normal and major. __Grey__ color bugs mean that the importance is either normal or low enhancement. __Red__ means that the importance of the bug is critical.

__5.__ __Bug ID:__ 679167 __Date Submitted:__ June 29, 2012 __Discussion:__ There are no recent discussion on this bug. There is just one description submitted by the person who reported the bug. __Current:__ No, the bug is not current. The last modification of the bug was on January 13, 2015. __Assigned:__ Yes, this bug is assigned to Maintainers of Gnome user documentation. __To Solve:__ The bug is just asking for documentation on the play queue's behavior when songs are manually added.

__6.__ __Bug ID:__ 787777  __Date Submitted:__ September 17, 2017 __Discussion:__ There are no recent discussion on this bug.

# Collective Reports

__1.__ 32 bugs were opened in the last 7 days and 38 were closed.

__2.__ More bugs were closed then opened in the last 7 days.

__3.__ The top three bug closers are Milan Crha with 11 bugs closed, Sebastian Dröge (slomo) with 8 bugs closed and Jens Georg with 5 bugs closed. Knowing the top bug closers is important because it gives beginners an idea as to who to ask for help. These are the people with the most experience and knowledge on how to handle bugs.

__4.__ The top three bug reporters are Sebastian Dröge (slomo) with 3 bugs reported, Nirbheek Chauhan with 3 bugs reported, Linus Svensson with 2 bugs reported. These people are different from bug closers, they are not necessarily working towards fixing the bugs. These are the people who can read code well and spot errors that need to be fixed. Sebastian Dröge appeared in this list and in the bug closers list.

__5.__ The top three reviewers of patches are Sebastian Dröge (slomo) with 38 patches reviewed, Nicolas Dufresne (ndufresne) with 4 patches reviewed, and Edward Hervey with 4 patches reviewed. Sebastian Droge, just like in the other lists, appeares to be in the top three. He is also in the top three in patch contributors.

__8.__ There were options to create a CSV file and a Line Graph
