I tried to edit Rego Park in Queens, my neighborhood, and it was interesting to see that many things that I thought would not be shown on OpenStreetMap's map already had edits on them. I was able to remove a ToysRus tag from a store because ToysRus has closed all of their US stores. In addition I added lables to clothing stores that didnt have any lables, such as Kohls and Century 21. I notice that there were missing pathways and sidewalks on the map, so I added those as well.
