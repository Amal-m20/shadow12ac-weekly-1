I tried to edit Rego Park in Queens, my Neighborhood, and it was interesting to see that many things that i thought would not be shown on OpenStreetMap's map already had edits on them. i was able to remove a ToysRus tag from a store because ToysRus has closed all of their US stores. In addition i added lables to clothing stores that didnt have any lables, such as Kohls and Century 21. i notice that there were missing pathways and sidewalks on the map, so i added those as well.
