## Assignment 1 - Contributing to OpenStreetMap


OpenStreetMap is a free, editable map of the entire world. It is continually growing by the efforts of volunteers who are adding details, whether it is small or big, about areas they are familiar with. For our first assignment I got to be part of OpenStreetMap's volunteer group and add in my own small details.

I tried to edit Rego Park in Queens, my neighborhood, and it was interesting to see that many things that I thought would not be shown on OpenStreetMap's map already had edits on them. For example, I was expecting to add in details about small parks and pathways that I believed only a few people would know off. However, to my surprise many of those places were already on the map. I was a little disappointed that I didn’t get to add any details about my favorite park near my house. But, after looking around the area more, I was able to remove a ToysRus tag from a store.  ToysRus has closed all their US stores and the map showed no indication of this. In addition, I added tags to clothing stores that didn’t have any labels, such as Kohls and Century 21. I didn’t really understand why these stores didn’t have any details on them even though Kohls and Century 21 are the most well-known stores in the area. After looking out for any more stores that needed tags, I started to focus on the pathways and sidewalks on the map. I was able to add missing pathways and sidewalks that are used often in the area.

All these edit and details can be viewed at: <https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/shadow12ac/history>
