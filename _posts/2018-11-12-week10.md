# Assignment 11: Setting Up A Project

## Readings

This week we have finally picked out the projects we want to work on and about to start our journey to contribute anything useful in to these projects. To contribute to a project there is a standard workflow used in GitHub called the GitHub flow. This GitHub flow can be found at [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/). I thought this a very simple and straight forward site explaining the steps in the flow. 

Scott Chacon, a developer at GitHub, wrote an [post](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) explaining why GitHub uses the GitHub flow instead of the git-flow. I found out about the git-flow through our previous assignments, but i was always under the assumption that GitHub used the same workflow. Scott Chacon's post was very informative and explanined the differences between the two flows very well.
