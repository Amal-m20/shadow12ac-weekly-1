## Progress Report on Cosmos Project

This week our team made it a goal to make contributions to the project we chose, [Open Genus - Cosmos](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos). As a team we created a Slack group in order to commicate and ask questions about our work with each other. It took about a day or two but we came up with a small list of issues in the project that we thought were possible for us to work on given the time we had left. We cut the list down to two issues, the Ant-Optimixation Problem and the Ugly Number issue, and also decided that to spit our 4 person team in to two smaller teams so we can tackle two issues at the time. Both these issues didnt require 4 people to solve it.

Anupam and I decided to work on Ugly Numbers, while Liudmila and Jimmy worked on the Ant-Optimization issue. Ugly numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. The code, when provided with a number n, is required to print out the n'th Ugly Number. Anupam implemented the code while i looked it over, tested it and checked if the format of the code was acceptable for Cosmos based on the rules they provided. 

In the next few days our next goal is to swap both teams code, give it a final review and then issue a pull request.
