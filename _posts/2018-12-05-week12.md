## Progressive Report on Cosmos Project

This week our team made it a goal to make contributions to the project we chose, [Open Genus - Cosmos](https://github.com/OpenGenus/cosmos). As a team we created a Slack group in order to commicate and ask questions about our work with each other. It took about a day or two but we came up with a small list of issues in the project that we thought were possible for us to work on given the time we had left. We cut the list down to two issues, the Ant-Optimixation Problem and the Ugly Number issue, and also decided that to spit our 4 person team in to two smaller teams so we can tackle two issues at the time. Both these issues didnt require 4 people to solve it.
