## Assignment 8: A Second Git Workfow Exercise

This week we had a very simple but interesting task. In the assignment we were split in teams and for each person in the team we had to had to write code that would print an odditie from the `odditites.txt` file. The file contains single-lined sententences that are true facts. The assignment was designed so that we run in to merge conflicts and gave us a chance to figure out how to handle them. 

I found this excercise to be very helpful in understanding how merge conflicts can form and how to resolve them. As the exercise said my team and I did run in to merge conflicts while trying to merge pull requests. I learned how to use the conflict editor on _GitHub_ to solve any and all conflicts that emerged. I used [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github/) to learn how to use the conflict editor.
