## Assignment 6: Collaborative Editing

For this week’s assignment we got to apply what we learned from our previous assignment and improve on our teammate’s past posts. We used the Git workflow from assignment 5 to clone our teammate’s posts and edit them. However, there was a new twist to the workflow. We created local and remote branches that contain revisions made by our teammates. These branches were then merged with the master branch as the final step. 

I really enjoyed this assignment, it accomplished many goals simultaneously. The assignment helped us improve our writing, taught us about branching in Git, and gave us experience with working in groups and improving upon other people’s work. The assignment was relatively easy and editing my teammate’s posts was fun. However, I had some difficulties merging the different branches, which contained my teammate’s revisions, to my master branch. I encountered some merge conflicts and was little confused as to how the Github merge conflict editor worked. It took a while and some online reading to figure it out. Once that was solved, I completed the assignment without any further problems. Assignments such as this one help me get comfortable working on Github and with Git, which I appreciate a lot.
