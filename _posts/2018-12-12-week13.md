## Assignment 13: About Software Licenses

### Differences Between the GNU Public Licenses
- __GNU General Public License (GPL):__ The most recent version of the GNU GPL is version 3. Its a free software license and a copyleft license, it is used in many software packages.

- __GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL):__ Verion 3 is the most recent verion of LGPL. Just like GNU GPL, LGPL is a free software license. However unline GPL, LGPL is not a strong copyleft license because the license permits linking with nonfree modules. This version of LGPL is compatible with version 3 of GPL. 

- __GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL):__ there is only one version of this license, version 3. This license is just like GNU GPL, however with an added part that allow users who use the licensed software of the network to be able to recieve the source of that program. This license is recommended to to be used for any software that would be used over a network.

### Distinguishing Between GPL, Apache and Mozilla Licenses. 
- __General Public Licenses:__ Its a free software and copyleft license. The most recent version of it is version 3.

- __Apache License:__ This is alsos a free software license that is compatible with GNU GPL version 3 but not with version 2. Its not compatible with version 2 because there are some requirements, such as patent termination and indemnification provisions, that are not in version 2 of GPL. This is a good thing because if there is a momemnt where someone using this licensed is sued for patent infringment then the licenses terminates itself.

- __Mozilla Public License (MPL):__ Just like the previously discussed licenses, MPL is a free software license that is indirectly compatible with many GNU licenses, such as GPL, LGPL and AGPL. Mozilla can only be combined with GNU licenses if one condition is met. The condition is that everything that was originally under MPL will continue to have the MPL rights after combining with GNU Licenses. This creates a dual license with MPL and GNU licenses.
