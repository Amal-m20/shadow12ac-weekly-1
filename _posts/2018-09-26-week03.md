## Assignment 4&5: Getting Started With Git 

Git is one of the most commonly used versions of control systems today. This new assignment was very insightful for me because it gave me the chance to learn about Git and the workflow, called *Integration Manager Workflow*, which is used by many open source projects. I have never used Git before so the first thing I did was read the book [ProGit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub. This book helped me understand the basic workings and commands of Git. For the assignment we had to `Fork` a blessed repository into our personal repository. From there I was able to `clone` the form to my local machine and work on the repository as I saw fit.  Once I created a new file with the correct C++ program, I was able to use Git commands, such as `Git Add` and `Git Commit`, to push my file to my repository on GitHub. The final step was to open a pull request and wait for my professor to review my file and merge it. 

This was a very light assignment which did not require much code, but it was very helpful in applying what I learned from the book. I am looking forward to future projects and being able to use Git to push and pull my files.
