## Assignment 3: Reading about Wikipedia

As most people know Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia, written by the shared efforts of the people who use it. This site is constantly changing, new pages and improvments to old pages are created daily. These new pages and edits are thoroughly inspected by qualified and authorized editors. However, there is always a case where someone does not agree with the editors oppinion and major actions take place. this was the case for Erika Herzog. 

In this article,["Running for Office is Hard When You have a Porn Starâ€™s Name. This Makes it Worse"](https://qz.com/1352568/running-for-office-is-hard-when-you-have-a-porn-stars-name-this-makes-it-worse/) by Annalisa Merelli on Quartz, tried to produce a Wiki page for Catalina Cruz who is running in a Democrat primary for a seat in the Ney Work Assemble form Queens. From the title of the article, Erika Herzog's reasoning behind making a wiki page seemed obvious. However it was shut down because Catilina Cruz wasnt "notable" enough to have her own page on Wikipedia. I found that alittle absurd, Herzog provided many citations to prove how notable Catilina is. I definetly feel like Catilina deserved her own page just so that she doesnt get confused with the porn star who has the same name. In addition, Crus's opponent had a page dedicated to him, it only seemed fair that Catilina have one too. I support what Herzog was fighting for, but i dont agree with her methods. She shouldnt have revealed a Wiki Editor's real name compromising his identity, it was not the right way to fight for the page. Catilina Cruz's page will only be published now if she wins the election.
